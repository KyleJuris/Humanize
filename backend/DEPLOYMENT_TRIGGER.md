# Deployment Trigger - URGENT FIX

This file is used to trigger a new deployment on Render.

## Issue
The backend server is running an older version causing 404 errors for:
- GET /api/stripe/subscription-status
- GET /api/stripe/session-status  
- All /api/stripe/* endpoints

## Root Cause
The server was loading stripe-clean.js but the /subscription-status route was missing, causing 404 errors.

## Solution
This file forces a new deployment with the latest configuration that includes:
- Added /subscription-status route to stripe-clean.js
- Added authentication middleware to stripe-clean.js
- Fixed profiles API null ID constraint error
- Enhanced debugging logs

## Files Updated
- backend/routes/stripe-clean.js (added subscription-status route + auth middleware)
- backend/routes/profiles.js (fixed null ID constraint)
- backend/server.js (route registration)

## Critical Fixes
1. Added missing GET /api/stripe/subscription-status endpoint
2. Fixed profiles API null ID constraint error (code 23502)
3. Added proper authentication middleware to stripe routes
