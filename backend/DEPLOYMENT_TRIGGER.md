# Deployment Trigger

This file is used to trigger a new deployment on Render.

## Issue
The backend server is running an older version without the stripe-hosted routes, causing 404 errors for:
- GET /api/auth/me
- GET /api/projects  
- POST /api/stripe-hosted/create-checkout-session

## Solution
This file forces a new deployment with the latest server.js configuration that includes:
- Stripe-hosted route registration
- Enhanced debugging logs
- Proper API endpoint configuration

## Files Updated
- backend/server.js (route registration)
- backend/routes/stripe-hosted.js (new file)
- backend/lib/stripe.js (new file)
- backend/package.json (added stripe dependency)
