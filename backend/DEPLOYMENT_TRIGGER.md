# Deployment Trigger

This file is used to trigger a new deployment on Render.

## Issue
The backend server is running an older version causing 404 errors for:
- GET /api/stripe/subscription-status
- GET /api/stripe/session-status
- Other /api/stripe/* routes

## Solution
This file forces a new deployment with the latest configuration that includes:
- Fixed stripe-clean.js route loading
- Added /subscription-status endpoint with authentication
- Removed placeholder key validation that was blocking route loading
- Enhanced debugging logs

## Files Updated
- backend/routes/stripe-clean.js (added subscription-status route, fixed loading)
- backend/routes/profiles.js (fixed null ID constraint error)
